  title={Joke comprehension by Spanish B2 level learners of English.},
  author={Arróniz, S.},
  year={2019},
  abstract={This work undertakes an empirical study of one of the least researched issues in interlanguage pragmatics so far{:} comprehension of jokes by Spanish learners of English as a second language (L2, henceforth). It seeks to examine whether these learners grasp the humor some joking texts are intended to produce, which types of jokes prove to be more difficult to understand and why. Adopting a relevance-theoretic perspective on comprehension, and, more precisely, the model of comprehension envisaged in the cognitive-pragmatic framework put forward by Sperber and Wilson (1986/1995), this work relies on the classification of jokes recently proposed by Yus (2016), where jokes are sorted out into seven different types depending on three parameters which are purportedly exploited by humorists in their creation and are, therefore, responsible for their triggering the expected effect. Consequently, this work presents the results obtained through an online questionnaire that was administered to students of English as an L2 with an upperintermediate, B2 level who were enrolled in one of the compulsory courses of the Degree in English Studies taught at the Universidad de Sevilla. Owing to its limitations, this work cannot but be considered an initial, exploratory study that aims to spark off further research contributing to a better and deeper understanding of the problems that L2 learners may face when processing humorous texts.},

  author={Arróniz, S. and Coulter-Kern, M.},
  year={2020},
  abstract={This study investigates the acquisition and production of the trill in Spanish following heterosyllabic consonants (e.g. honrar) in advanced undergraduate participants and graduate students and uses native speakers (NS) as a baseline. The present study uses a variationist approach to investigate the social and individual factors that may impact the acquisition of the trill following heterosyllabic consonants, a cluster which has been described in previous studies as a trill, even though it is not orthographically written as two r’s, as in ca<rr>o. We are using a variationist approach to analyze both learner and NS production of the trill in Spanish using both formal and informal production instruments. We investigate motivation using the motivational framework and operationalizations of Ought-to self oriented motivation and L2 Context oriented motivation used by Dörnyei and Ushioda (2009). Our study investigates the impact of L2 Context oriented motivation (e.g. motivation to be part of a Spanish speaking community or the speakers of a specific Spanish speaking context) vs. Ought-to self oriented motivation (motivation to speak Spanish for class/work purposes or because one feels they Ought-to be able to) as well as social variables such as time spent abroad on the acquisition of the trill following heterosyllabic consonants. },

  title={Intonation and attitudes{:} Examining language attitudes toward Catalan by Peninsular Spanish speakers.},
  author={Arróniz, S.},
  year={2020},
  abstract={Research on language attitudes toward certain community groups is extensive and covers a wide range of phenomena and languages. This paper aims to investigate whether intonation, as a prosodic component and, frequently, a distinctive feature of certain languages, can trigger different attitudes, depending on whether or not the identity of the speaker is disclosed. To this end, a group of ten speakers of peninsular Spanish participated in a perception study in which pitch modifications were used with a synthetic voice to reflect intonation contours specific to neutral polar questions and information-seeking wh-questions in two languages in contact{:} Spanish and Catalan. The participants heard two versions of each token, both of them in Spanish, but one with a Castilian-accented L+H* intonation, and the other with a Catalan-accented H+L* intonation. Subsequently, they heard the same audio recordings once again, but this time the place of origin of each manipulation was disclosed; that is, either from Madrid (Castilian) or Catalonia (Catalan). The results confirm not only that intonation is a linguistic trait that does trigger attitudes on its own, but also that there is a strong social dimension to how Spanish speakers perceive Catalan, beyond language.},
