This preliminary study focuses on the role of pitch as the only perceptual cue for conveying up to three possible sentence meanings in Peninsular Spanish. A perceptual experiment was developed in which different modiÔ¨Åcations of the same word were included. The only change was the pitch height of the stressed syllable. The results seem to show that a low pitch is associated with a broad focus statement, and a high pitch with an echo yes/no question. However, a third category (narrow focus statement) located in the middle of the tonal range shows some variation among speakers.
